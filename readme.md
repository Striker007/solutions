Currently going through problems on [Leetcode](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/solutions/tree/master/java/leetcode) and [Cracking the Coding Interview](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/solutions/tree/master/java/cracking-the-coding-interview).

I try to combine code, explanations and visualisations in order to understand the problems. 

Each project has a respective mind map to go along with it. Below is an example of a mind map I have for [Cracking the Coding Interview](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/solutions/tree/master/java/cracking-the-coding-interview) :

If interested, this project is just a part of a more [generalised mind map](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/research) I am making and maintaining. This is just a sub mind map of it where I try to practice algorithmic problems and give solutions that I myself can review and understand.
