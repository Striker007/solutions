Currently going through problems on [Leetcode](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/solutions/tree/master/java/leetcode) and [Cracking the Coding Interview](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/solutions/tree/master/java/cracking-the-coding-interview/src).

I try to combine code, explanations and visualisations in order to understand the problems.
